## Projects

### BibSonomy
[BibSonomy](https://www.bibsonomy.org/) is a social bookmarking system as well as the underlying technical platform.
BibSonomy is run and developed by the Data Science Chair in cooperation with the [KDE group](https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/) of the University of Kassel, and the [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de), Germany.
The source code is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/bibsonomy/bibsonomy).

### DenseWeight
[DenseWeight](https://www.github.com/SteiMi/denseweight) is a python package that provides a method for dealing with imbalanced regression tasks.
The corresponding paper "Density-based weighting for imbalanced regression" is available [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06023-5).
